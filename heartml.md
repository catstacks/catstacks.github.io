## **Neural Networks: Heart Disease Classification**

**Project description:** The goal is to create a classification model that can accurately predict whether a patient will or won't have heart disease based on their recorded health metrics.  

>**Source:** The dataset was obtained from the [Heart Disease Classification - Neural Network](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshjnv/heart-disease-classification-neural-network/data) Kaggle Notebook data page. 

### Expected Correlations to the Target Feature

The following statements summarise the correlations that were expected based on common public health information.  

- Age negatively correlates (expected that younger particpants would be **less** likely to have heart disease)
- High blood pressure (trestbps) positively correlates (expected that those with higher blood pressure would be **more** likely to have heart disease) 
- Chest pain (cp) negatively correlates (expected that those with recorded chest pain for typical or atypical angina would be **more** likely to have heart disease)
- High cholesterol (chol) ositively correlates (expected that those with higher cholesterol would be **more** likely to have heart disease)  


```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
